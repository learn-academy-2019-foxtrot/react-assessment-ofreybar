1. Correctable True/False: Mark the following TRUE or FALSE. If FALSE, correct the statement to be TRUE.

- React is a modern, efficient answer to complex UI applications (true/false)

False - We ran yarn start and it automatically uploaded to the localhost when you saved the file.

- React is a full stack framework for modern web applications (true/false)
True

- React is a flexible library that plays the role of V in an MVC framework (true/false)

2. What are "smart" and "dumb" components? Explain the difference and also add why we bother to make the distinction between them.

  Your answer: Parents = smart, child = dumb.

  Researched answer: Smart components are app level components that perform functions and manage data while dumb components focus solely on the UI



3. When we use "yarn add ..." in the terminal - what is yarn doing? And what file will always be automatically updated after we add a package with yarn?

  Your answer: yarn add is adding packages. 

  Researched answer: This will install one or more packages in your dependencies.



4. What is the difference between component state and props? Your answer should include a short explanation of both.

  Your answer: Not sure...

  Researched answer: Basically, the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters.



5. How would you explain state to a friend who doesn't know code?

  Your answer: State displays what current values and contents the object is holding.
